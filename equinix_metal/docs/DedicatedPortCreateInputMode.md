# DedicatedPortCreateInputMode

The mode of the interconnection (only relevant to Dedicated Ports). Fabric VCs won't have this field. Can be either 'standard' or 'tunnel'.   The default mode of an interconnection on a Dedicated Port is 'standard'. The mode can only be changed when there are no associated virtual circuits on the interconnection.   In tunnel mode, an 802.1q tunnel is added to a port to send/receive double tagged packets from server instances.

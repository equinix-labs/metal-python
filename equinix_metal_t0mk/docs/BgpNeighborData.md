# BgpNeighborData


## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**address_family** | **int** | Address Family for IP Address. Accepted values are 4 or 6 | [optional] 
**customer_as** | **int** | The customer&#39;s ASN. In a local BGP deployment, this will be an internal ASN used to route within the data center. For a global BGP deployment, this will be the your own ASN, configured when you set up BGP for your project. | [optional] 
**customer_ip** | **str** | The device&#39;s IP address. For an IPv4 BGP session, this is typically the private bond0 address for the device. | [optional] 
**href** | **str** |  | [optional] 
**md5_enabled** | **bool** | True if an MD5 password is configured for the project. | [optional] 
**md5_password** | **str** | The MD5 password configured for the project, if set. | [optional] 
**multihop** | **bool** | True when the BGP session should be configured as multihop. | [optional] 
**peer_as** | **int** | The Peer ASN to use when configuring BGP on your device. | [optional] 
**peer_ips** | **List[str]** | A list of one or more IP addresses to use for the Peer IP section of your BGP configuration. For non-multihop sessions, this will typically be a single gateway address for the device. For multihop sessions, it will be a list of IPs. | [optional] 
**routes_in** | [**List[BgpRoute]**](BgpRoute.md) | A list of project subnets | [optional] 
**routes_out** | [**List[BgpRoute]**](BgpRoute.md) | A list of outgoing routes. Only populated if the BGP session has default route enabled. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from equinix_metal_t0mk.models.bgp_neighbor_data import BgpNeighborData

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of BgpNeighborData from a JSON string
bgp_neighbor_data_instance = BgpNeighborData.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print BgpNeighborData.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
bgp_neighbor_data_dict = bgp_neighbor_data_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of BgpNeighborData from a dict
bgp_neighbor_data_form_dict = bgp_neighbor_data.from_dict(bgp_neighbor_data_dict)

# BgpConfigDeploymentType

In a Local BGP deployment, a customer uses an internal ASN to control routes within a single Equinix Metal datacenter. This means that the routes are never advertised to the global Internet. Global BGP, on the other hand, requires a customer to have a registered ASN and IP space.
